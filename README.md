# ipl-score-prediction
The Indian Premier League (IPL) is one of the most popular and widely-watched T20 cricket leagues in the world. With its fast-paced and high-scoring nature, predicting the total score of a team in an IPL match is a challenging and valuable task. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques, specifically regression models, to predict the total runs a team is likely to score in an IPL match.

In this study, historical IPL match data comprising a wealth of information, including team performance, venue conditions, player statistics, and match outcomes, is used as the dataset. Feature engineering techniques are applied to extract relevant features from this dataset, including batting averages, strike rates, pitch conditions, and team strengths. These features are then used to train and evaluate several regression models, including linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression.

The project also explores the impact of various factors on the prediction accuracy, such as team composition, player form, pitch type, and match location. Special attention is given to feature selection and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.

The results of the regression models are evaluated using standard evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. The best-performing model is selected for the final prediction task.

The developed IPL score prediction model offers valuable insights for cricket enthusiasts, bookmakers, and team strategists. By accurately predicting a team's expected score, it aids in making informed decisions regarding betting, player selection, and match strategy.
